  name: "🔍 Pipeline Static Analysis"

# This job runs pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and standards across the repository.
# It performs automated checks on all files in the repository, including:
# - Code formatting
# - Linting
# - Security checks
# - Best practices validation
#
# The job runs automatically on changes to any file or can be triggered manually.
#
# The job extends the .precommit_tooling_setup template (from pipeline_tooling.yml),
# which installs required tools and sets up the pre-commit environment.
# NOTE: The .ssh_agent_setup template is available for extension if SSH agent setup is needed in future jobs.
