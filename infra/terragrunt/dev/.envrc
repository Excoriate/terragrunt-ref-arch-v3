# Development Environment Configuration
#
# This file provides a flexible configuration point for development-specific
# environment variables. It inherits from parent configurations and allows
# for environment-specific customizations.
#
# CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE:
# 1. Uncomment and modify the variables below to suit your development needs
# 2. Add new variables following the _safe_export pattern
# 3. Override global variables or add development-specific configurations
# 4. Use _display_exported_vars to see current environment setup

# Source parent .envrc for inheritance
source_up || true

# Ensure PROJECT_ROOT is set
PROJECT_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT:-$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)}"
export PROJECT_ROOT

# Source the shared utility functions
source "${PROJECT_ROOT}/scripts/envrc-utils.sh"

# Development Environment Variables
# Uncomment and modify these variables as needed:
# _safe_export DEV_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE "sandbox"
# _safe_export DEV_RESOURCE_LIMITS "minimal"
# _safe_export AWS_PROFILE "dev"
# _safe_export TG_INSTANCE_TYPE "t3.micro"
# _safe_export TG_MAX_CAPACITY "2"
# _safe_export TERRAGRUNT_LOG_LEVEL "debug"

# Display exported variables (optional)
_display_exported_vars "DEV_"
