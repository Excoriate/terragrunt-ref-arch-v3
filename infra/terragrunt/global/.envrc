# Global Environment Configuration
#
# This file provides a flexible configuration point for global-level
# environment variables. You can customize this file to set default
# values that can be inherited by other environments.
#
# CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE:
# 1. Uncomment and modify the variables below to suit your needs
# 2. Add new variables following the _safe_export pattern
# 3. Variables defined here can be overridden in child environments

# Source parent .envrc for inheritance
source_up || true

# Ensure PROJECT_ROOT is set
PROJECT_ROOT="${PROJECT_ROOT:-$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../.." && pwd)}"
export PROJECT_ROOT

# Source the shared utility functions
source "${PROJECT_ROOT}/scripts/envrc-utils.sh"

# Global Configuration Variables
# Uncomment and modify these variables as needed:
# _safe_export GLOBAL_CONFIG_PATH "${PROJECT_ROOT}/global/config"
# _safe_export GLOBAL_SHARED_RESOURCES "true"
# _safe_export AWS_REGION "us-east-1"
# _safe_export TF_STATE_BUCKET "my-terraform-state-bucket"

# Display exported variables (optional)
_display_exported_vars "GLOBAL_"
